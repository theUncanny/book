= An I/O Project Building a Small Grep

This chapter is both a recap of the many skills you've learned so far and an exploration of a few more standard library features. We're going to build a command-line tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to practice some of the Rust you now have under your belt.

Rust's speed, safety, 'single binary' output, and cross-platform support make it a good language for creating command line tools, so for our project we'll make our own version of the classic command line tool `grep`. Grep is an acronym for "Globally search a Regular Expression and Print." In the simplest use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string using the following steps:

* Take as arguments a filename and a string.
* Read the file.
* Find lines in the file that contain the string argument.
* Print out those lines.

We'll also show how to use environment variables and print to standard error instead of standard out; these techniques are commonly used in command line tools.

One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully-featured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`. By comparison, our version of `grep` will be fairly simple, this chapter will give you some of the background knowledge to help you understand a real-world project like `ripgrep`.

This project will bring together a number of concepts you've learned so far:

* Organizing code (using what we learned in modules, Chapter 7)
* Using vectors and strings (collections, Chapter 8)
* Handling errors (Chapter 9)
* Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (Chapter 10)
* Writing tests (Chapter 11)

We'll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which Chapters 13 and 17 will cover in detail.

Let's create a new project with, as always, `cargo new`. We're calling our project `greprs` to distinguish from the `grep` tool that you may already have on your system:

[source,text]
----
$ cargo new --bin greprs
     Created binary (application) `greprs` project
$ cd greprs
----
